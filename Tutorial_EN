Evaluating the Quality of Transcriptome Assemblies
by Tiago Belintani

Objective:
To perform statistical analyses, compile results in comparative tables, and—of course—celebrate (modestly) those first victories on the grand journey through data.

1. Setting Up the Environment: Like a Good Old-Fashioned Lab
Open a new screen session—because a frozen terminal is punishment reserved for those who never learned Unix in the days of yore.


screen -S stats_assembly
To reconnect to your session, in case your connection drops (which, naturally, will happen at the worst possible moment):


screen -r stats_assembly
2. Creating the Conda Environment
Because a messy environment only belongs in a grad student’s fridge.


conda create -n stats_assembly_transcriptomas \
-c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults \
busco python=3.11 assembly-stats
Activate the environment:


conda activate stats_assembly_transcriptomas
3. (Skipped in original)
(You might want to add the Busco installation step here, but let’s stick to your current outline for tradition’s sake.)

4. Generating Statistics with Assembly-Stats
To avoid just saying, “Everything looks great,” let’s actually look at the numbers.

Basic:


assembly-stats my_assembly.fasta
Or, the more elegant and explicit way with an absolute path (a habit of anyone who’s ever deleted the wrong folder):


assembly-stats /home/your_name/your_folder/sub_folder/assembly.fasta
Real-life example:


assembly-stats /home/tiagobelintani/mepraia_2025/MEPRAIA/assembly/trinity_Mp17.Trinity.fasta
Expected output:


stats for /home/tiagobelintani/mepraia_2025/MEPRAIA/assembly/trinity_Mp17.Trinity.fasta

sum = 46745600, n = 58957, ave = 792.88, largest = 23813
N50 = 1338, n = 9576
N60 = 1012, n = 13579
N70 = 709, n = 19083
N80 = 462, n = 27294
N90 = 302, n = 39966
N100 = 169, n = 58957
N_count = 0
Gaps = 0

5. Comparative Table
Build a table for each species, side by side—because comparison is the soul of science (and lunchroom debates).

6. Running BUSCO — Because Even Traditionalists Like Something New
Enter your working directory:


cd transcriptome/
mkdir busco_analyses
cd busco_analyses/
Download the desired lineage; here, we’ll use Araneae (spiders are forever):


wget https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/lineages/araneae_odb12.2025-04-11.tar.gz
tar -xzvf araneae_odb12.2025-04-11.tar.gz
Run via your job script or directly—whichever keeps your cluster admins happy.

Basic command:


busco -i /home/your_name/your_project/assembly/your_assembly.fasta \
      -l /home/your_name/your_project/busco_analyses/araneae_odb12 \
      -o your_assembly_BUSCO -m transcriptome -c 12 --offline
Refer to the job_busco.sh file for a job submission template.
